      (save the MNISTFashion Dataset)
    - correct_img/, correct_gen_img/, correct_latent_z/ \
      (Examples selected from the MNIST Fashion test set, where "correct" refers to images correctly classified by the CNN. The first folder contains the original images, the second folder contains images generated by the GAN, and the third folder contains the latent-z values required by the GAN.)
    - incorrect_img/, incorrect_gen_img/, incorrect_latent_z/ \
       (incorrectly classified)
    - latent_g_input_saved
      (for MNIST Digits Dataset)
    - true_label_Ankle_Boot_predicted_label_Sneaker_16.pt
      (latent z of a example for incorrected images)

  - images_plot_explanation/

    - Digits \
      (Stored is an image of a handwritten digit 8 that was classified as 3. PIECE was utilized to generate both a semicounterfactual and a counterfactual image. The process involves altering one x-feature at a time, resulting in the generation of an image for each feature modification.)
